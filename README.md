-Jean Jecha : A data directory containing files to load in and clean up the data.

-Marvin Scott : An Analysis directory containing a file (or files) for exploratory data analysis

-Najeeb Zaidi :	A Paper directory containing a file (plain text or Markdown) that explains any meaningful patterns in this dataset.
